# 5. Password Checker Task: Create a simple password checker.

# Ask the user to enter a password.
# If the password is shorter than 8 characters, print "Password is too short."
# If the password doesnâ€™t contain at least one uppercase letter, print "Password must contain an uppercase letter.".
# If the password meets both criteria, print "Password is strong."

password = input("Please, enter a password: ")

if len(password) < 8:
    print("Password is too short.")
elif password.islower():
    print("Password must contain an uppercase letter.")

    print("Password is strong.")
